## Deadline

We had one week to complete this.  


## Technologies used

What was used: 
- `setInterval()`
- `setTimeout()`
- Arrow Functions `() => {}`
- Functions `function thisSeemsFun() {}`
- Array & it's methods `loop.filter()`
- Local Storage
- Classes
- Event Listeners
- User Input via key strokes

## How to play

You are Pac-Man and the goal of the game is to eat all of the pellets on the game while avoiding the ghosts, which end the game as soon as you are hit by one.  
If you get one of the big pellets, the ghost are then scared and you get to munch the ghosts.  
You will gain more score, the more ghosts you eat.  
You use the arrow keys to move Pac-Man (WASD will soon be implemented).
